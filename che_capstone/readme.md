# Basic implementation of a chemical process simulator using [Thermo](https://thermo.readthedocs.io/index.html#) and [ChemPy](https://bjodah.github.io/chempy/latest/)

- Currently implementation converges all flows to steady state from "Basis" key in **[cfg.json](https://github.com/hunterviolette/24spring/blob/main/che_capstone/cfg.json)**
- Overall heat duty calculation for reactors: 
  ```Q (kJ/mol) = enthalpy_streams_out - enthalpy_streams_in + heat_of_reaction ```

- MgCl2 is in balance with N2 and NH3 but not with O2 and H2O due to HCl recycle in R-103.
- H2O is in balance with O2, ensuring overall material balance conservation.
